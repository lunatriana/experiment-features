# Let's experiment with Git features!

## 🤔What is a Git? 
Imagine you're working on a big drawing with your friends. You each have your own copy of the drawing. If you make a mistake, you can go back to an earlier version of your drawing and fix it. So that's what Git does with code.

## 🍄Git Commands
🤗Here are some basic components of Git concepts that can help us understand and work with Git effectively! (in baby language):
1. **Repository (Repo)**: A repo is basically your scrapbook where all the drawings (code) are kept.
2. **Clone**: If your friend likes your drawing, they can make a copy of your scrapbook to work on too. That's cloning
3. **Add**: When you're working on your drawing and you've made some changes that you want to save, you tell Git, "I want to include this part in my next picture!" That's what Git does--it gets your changes ready to be saved.
4. **Commit**: When you finish a part of your drawing and want to save it, you take a picture and put it in your scrapbook. That picture is a commit.
5. Push: When you're done with your updates, you can share them with your friend so they can see what you've added. That's pushing.
