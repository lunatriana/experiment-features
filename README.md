# Let's experiment with Git features!

## ü§îWhat is a Git? 
Imagine you're working on a big drawing with your friends. You each have your own copy of the drawing. If you make a mistake, you can go back to an earlier version of your drawing and fix it. So that's what Git does with code.

## üçÑGit Commands
ü§óHere are some basic components of Git concepts that can help us understand and work with Git effectively! (in baby language):
1. **Config**: Before you start drawing, you might need to set up your crayons and paper just like the way you like them. Git config is like telling Git, "This is who I am, and this is how I like to work!" It helps Git remember your name, email, and other important settings, so everything runs smoothly.
2. **Repository (Repo)**: A repo is basically your scrapbook where all the drawings (code) are kept.
3. **Clone**: If your friend likes your drawing, they can make a copy of your scrapbook to work on too. That's cloning
4. **Add**: When you're working on your drawing and you've made some changes that you want to save, you tell Git, "I want to include this part in my next picture!" That's what Git does--it gets your changes ready to be saved.
5. **Commit**: When you finish a part of your drawing and want to save it, you take a picture and put it in your scrapbook. That picture is a commit.
6. **Push**: When you're done with your updates, you can share them with your friend so they can see what you've added. That's pushing.
7. **Pull**: If your friend made something cool in their scrapbook, you can grab it and add it to yours. That's pulling.
8. **Merge**: If you like what you did on the new page, you can glue it back onto the original drawing. That's called merging.
9, **Fetch**: Imagine your friend is working on their own scrapbook and has made some new pictures. Git fetch is like saying, "Hey, Git, go see if my friend has any new pictures!" It brings those new pictures (changes) to you so you can decide if you want to add them to your scrapbook.
10. **Branch**: If you want to try something new on your drawing without changing the original, you start a new page in your scrapbook. That new page is a branch.
